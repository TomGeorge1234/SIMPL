## Installation and Usage
This repository contains code for the ICLR 2025 paper "_SIMPL: Scalable and hassle-free optimisation of neural representations from behaviour_" ([ICLR](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9kFaNwX6rv)). Specifically: 

* Source code in `simpl/` for the SIMPL algorithm.
* A working example in `demos/simpl_demo.ipynb`.

To run the example you will need to install `simpl` by 

1. **Clone**: `git clone https://github.com/TomGeorge1234/SIMPL.git` and navigate to the root: `cd SIMPL`
3. _(Recommended)_ Create a virtual environment (e.g. `python -m venv simpl_env` and `source simpl_env/bin/activate`). 
4. **Install**: `pip install .[demo]`. This will install the `simpl` package and its dependencies.
5. **Run the demo**: `jupyter notebook demos/simpl_demo.ipynb` !
