   "source": "## Check 2: Can information keep up with the animal?\n\nNot all spikes are equal — a spike from a spatially tuned neuron constrains position far more than one from a flat-firing neuron. We quantify this with **Skaggs spatial information** (bits/spike):\n\n$$I_n = \\sum_x \\frac{r_n(x)}{\\bar{r}_n} \\log_2 \\frac{r_n(x)}{\\bar{r}_n} \\, P(x)$$\n\nwhere $r_n(x)$ is the firing rate of neuron $n$ at position $x$, $\\bar{r}_n$ is its mean firing rate, and $P(x)$ is the occupancy. The population **information rate** is:\n\n$$\\dot{\\mathcal{I}} = \\sum_n \\bar{r}_n \\cdot I_n \\qquad \\text{(bits/s)}$$\n\n### Deriving the localization length\n\nOver a time window $\\tau$, the decoder accumulates $\\dot{\\mathcal{I}} \\cdot \\tau$ bits. In a $D$-dimensional environment of side $L$, resolving position to precision $\\ell$ requires distinguishing $(L/\\ell)^D$ possible locations, which costs $D \\log_2(L/\\ell)$ bits. The decoder can localise to precision $\\ell$ if:\n\n$$\\dot{\\mathcal{I}} \\cdot \\tau \\geq D \\log_2 \\frac{L}{\\ell}$$\n\nThe natural timescale is self-consistent: $\\tau = \\ell / v$, the time for the animal (moving at speed $v$) to cross the resolution element itself. Longer than this and the animal has moved; shorter and we're asking for more precision than the window supports. Substituting:\n\n$$\\dot{\\mathcal{I}} \\cdot \\frac{\\ell}{v} = D \\log_2 \\frac{L}{\\ell}$$\n\nTo solve, note that $\\log_2(L/\\ell) = \\ln(L/\\ell) / \\ln 2$. For the self-consistent solution where the decoder is just barely keeping up, the dominant balance gives:\n\n$$\\ell^* = \\frac{D \\, v \\, \\ln 2}{\\dot{\\mathcal{I}}}$$\n\n(This is exact when $\\ell^* \\ll L$, where $\\log_2(L/\\ell)$ varies slowly compared to $\\ell$ itself.)\n\n### The localization speed\n\nSince $\\ell^* \\propto v$, faster movement means coarser resolution. There is a critical speed $v^*$ at which the localization length reaches the environment size ($\\ell^* = L$), i.e. the decoder can barely localise at all:\n\n$$L = \\frac{D \\, v^* \\, \\ln 2}{\\dot{\\mathcal{I}}} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad v^* = \\frac{\\dot{\\mathcal{I}} \\, L}{D \\, \\ln 2}$$\n\nThe diagnostic ratio is:\n\n$$\\frac{v^*}{v} = \\frac{L}{\\ell^*}$$\n\n- $v^*/v \\gg 1$: information arrives much faster than the animal moves — comfortable margin for decoding.\n- $v^*/v \\gtrsim 1$: marginal — the decoder can just keep up.\n- $v^*/v < 1$: the animal outpaces the information — the decoder cannot localise."
